- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m PaweÅ‚,

- ğŸ‘€ I started my professional career working on a new and advanced project. The application that I was creating allows managing the entire shipbuilding industry, from "entry" to "exit" of a ship from a shipyard. The application allows work on both sides - shipyard employees and their contractors. The complexity of the application, very advanced business logic, and work under the supervision of senior developers required me to work at the highest level. In the project, I used the latest technologies. 
(React / ES6 / React Hooks / Custom Hooks / ReactQuery Emotion / Cypress)

- I also conducted research for a new project and created a demo of the application according to the client's requirements. GIS maps, an application whose task is rendering point clouds, creating 3d / 2d models from objects, handling LIDAR laser files, vector, and raster layouts, drawing and modeling objects, importing, and exporting files, etc. â€¨(Leaflet / React Map GL / CessiumJS / Potree / Three.js )

- Outside of working hours, I spend a lot of time consolidating my programming skills and learning about new technologies.
