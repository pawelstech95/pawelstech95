- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m PaweÅ‚ Stech,

- ğŸ‘€ For over a year I interest in programming and I learn Javascript
focusing especially on front-end development with React as the
main framework/library. I gain my knowledge from online courses
which started to be my daily routine. I try not to be the next junior
after Bootcamp who heard about programming as the best source
of income. My interest in computer science is much bigger, but Iâ€™ve
never had a good mentor who could show me the right direction of
learning. Nowadays, programming started to be my passion and I
would like to start my programmer career as a Junior React
Developer.
